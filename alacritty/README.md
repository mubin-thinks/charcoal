## Installing Charcoal for Alacritty
Before we begin our installation, we must have a text-editor(i.e. Neovim, VSCode,
Notepad etc.) as you will have to edit some files.

The next step is to install the latest stable release of Charcoal. You can download it
from [here](https://github.com/mubin-thinks/charcoal/releases/latest).

You can then `cd` or go to the `charcoal/alacritty/` directory. Then, choose the theme
file you want to install. Then, Open it through a text-editor. After that, copy all the
text and paste it on top of `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` (for Linux & Mac) or
`%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml` (for Windows). Lastly, make sure to save the
file.

After saving the file, Charcoal is installed.
